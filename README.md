Code for my bachelor thesis:
This repository contains all the programming code I used for my bachelor thesis.

Usage:
If you want to test random data like me, you can run the different run... python files for each problem.
If you want specific test sizes you can change them in the createData... python files for each problem.

If you want to test your own data with these models, then you can create a .txt file in a specific format to test your data.
The testdata.txt must be in the correct format to be parsed correctly.
You can see examples in my thesis.
